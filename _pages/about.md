Hello there, I am a computational social science researcher, applying technology to study technology's impact on society. My work builds upon network science, natural language processing, and social science to study digital spaces. 


**What am I currently up to?**

I am currently a Postdoc with Prof. Isabelle Augestein at [CopeNLU](https://www.copenlu.com/), Department of Computer Science, University of Copenhagen. In my postdoc, I am investigating the use of computational techniques to study narrative styles and their role in misinformation. I am hosted at the picturesque [Pioneer Center of AI](https://www.aicentre.dk/the-centre-p1).

Since 2020, I have been volunteering as a reviewer for the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/reviewed_by/@sara-02). I  classify myself as an avid reader, a seasonal poet ðŸ˜‰ and a reluctant speaker. A *not-so-updated* list of my talks, open mics, and presentation material is available [here](https://github.com/sara-02/pradarshan).

**What was my Phd thesis on?**

Supervised by Dr. Tanmoy Chakraborty and Prof. Vikram Goyal, I worked on applying computational techniques to analyse hate speech on the Web. I was hosted at [Laboratory for Computational Social Systems (LCS2)](https://lcs2.iiitd.edu.in/) at Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology, New Delhi. In 2024, I was selected as one of the Young Researchers for the 11th [Heidelberg Laureate Forum](https://www.heidelberg-laureate-forum.org/).

During my Phd, I was fortunate to receive financial support from Google Phd Fellowship (2023-2024), the Prime Minister Doctoral Research Fellowship - PMRF (2020-2023), and WiproAI (2020-2023).

For summer 2023 (May-July), I was a visiting researcher at the School of Social Science and Technology, Technical University of Munich, hosted by Prof. JÃ¼rgen Pfeffer. My visit there was supported by the Overseas Research Fellowship at IIIT-Delhi.

**What was I up to in my previous life?**

Prior to joining academia, I worked as a data scientist in developer tooling at Red Hat, Bangalore, for 2.5 years. The work revolved around providing developer analytics to the OpenShift.io platform. Our work contributed to a plugin on [VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.fabric8-analytics) and got featured in [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/02/red-hat-launches-openshift-io-an-online-ide-for-building-container-based-applications/). Even before that, in 2016, I obtained a Bachelor's in Technology in Computer Science & Engineering from Jamia Millia Islamia.

From 2015 to 2024, I was a volunteer and mentor with AnitB.org. I also served as a member of their [AI Committee](https://membership.anitab.org/page/connect-with-the-Artificial-Intelligence-Committee).
